# Data Sets :rocket:

**What is "open data"?** 

[Here is a good definition and discussion of the term OPEN DATA](https://opendatahandbook.org/guide/en/what-is-open-data/)

---
- [Google Dataset Search](https://datasetsearch.research.google.com/)
  
   Works like Google search, excepts it searches through other dataset databases as well (including Kaggle, etc.)

- [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/)
  
   An enormous community-based collection of data sets and data projects; an important resource for ML.

- [UCI Datasets](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets.php)
  
   497 Open Data Sets maintained by UCI's Center for Machine Learning and Intelligent Systems.

- [OpenData AWS](https://registry.opendata.aws/)
  
   These are open data sets available on AWS.  "This registry exists to help people discover and share datasets that are available via AWS resources... See datasets from Facebook Data for Good, NASA Space Act Agreement, NIH STRIDES, NOAA Big Data Project, and Space Telescope Science Institute."

- [Data Portals](http://dataportals.org/)
  
   Maintained by the Open Knowledge Foundation, good, free data sets. "A Comprehensive List of Open Data Portals from Around the World."

- [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_datasets_for_machine-learning_research)
  
   A good, community-updated list.

- [Open Data Monitor](https://opendatamonitor.eu/frontend/web/index.php)
  
   Also connected to the Open Knowledge Foundation.

# Other Data Resources

- [Quandl](https://www.quandl.com/)
  
   "Quandl delivers market data from hundreds of sources via API, or directly into Python, R, Excel and many other tools." Careful --this is NOT Open Date, they charge $$ for some.

- [IMF Global Financial Data](https://www.imf.org/external/pubs/ft/weo/2016/01/weodata/download.aspx)

- [OECD Better Life Index](https://stats.oecd.org/Index.aspx?DataSetCode=BLI)

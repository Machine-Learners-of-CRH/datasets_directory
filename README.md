**What is "open data"?**

   Works like Google search, excepts it searches through other dataset databases as well (including Kaggle, etc.)
   
- [Google Created Datasets](https://research.google/tools/datasets/)
  
   This is a great, diverse collection of open datasets made by various teams at Google (more than 2K people involved!).

   Maintained by the Open Knowledge Foundation, good, free data sets. "A Comprehensive List of Open Data Portals from Around the World."
